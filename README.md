## Game Rules

The rules of the game are simple.<br>
1 - First Add at least 2 players to start the game. The maximum number of players are 3.<br>
2 - Each player is given a bingo card with a grid of numbers from 1 to 24, where the middle card is empty with no number
in it.<br>
3 - You will then draw the numbers by clicking on the <b><i>Draw</i></b> button on the master board.<br>
4 - Then by every draw it will randomly call out numbers, and the corresponding numbers will be marked on the players card.<br>
5 - The first player to mark off 5 numbers in a row, column or diagonal sequence is the winner!
6 - However, the empty point of the player's card (the one without number) will be considered positive for a bingo sequence.<br>
7 - After the game has already obtained some "lucky ones", you can see a list of the winners in the main menu.
